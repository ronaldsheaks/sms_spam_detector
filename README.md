# sms_spam_detector
OSU AI Bootcamp - Transformers Challenge

Overview

This project is an SMS Spam Detection app that classifies SMS text messages as either spam or not spam. The app is built using a TF-IDF Vectorizer and a Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) in a scikit-learn pipeline. The app interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to input text messages and receive predictions in real-time.

How It Works

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages, where each message is classified as either spam or ham (not spam).
The app takes in an SMS text message through a simple interface.
It then predicts whether the message is spam or not spam using the pre-trained classification model.
The app outputs a message indicating whether the SMS is classified as spam or not.
Features

User Input: Users can enter any SMS text they want to classify.
Spam Detection: The app will classify the text message as either spam or not spam.
Clear and Flag: Simple buttons to reset the input or flag the message for review.
Technologies Used

Python: The main programming language used for the project.
Scikit-learn: Used to build the machine learning pipeline, which includes a TF-IDF vectorizer and an SVC model.
Gradio: Provides the user interface for inputting SMS text and viewing the prediction.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham. Each row in the dataset contains two columns:

label: The label indicating whether the message is spam or ham.
text_message: The SMS text content.
How to Run the Project

Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <rhttps://github.com/ronaldsheaks/sms_spam_detector.git>
Install the Required Libraries: Install the necessary dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the App: Launch the Gradio interface:
Copy code
python gradio_sms_text_classification.py
Use the App:
Open the local link generated by Gradio.
Enter an SMS text message into the input box.
Click on Submit to classify the message as either spam or not spam.
Example Input and Output

Input: "You are a lucky winner of $5000!"
Output: The text message: "You are a lucky winner of $5000!", is not spam.
Input: "Claim your free prize by clicking here! Text FA to 87121."
Output: The text message: "Claim your free prize by clicking here! Text FA to 87121.", is spam.
Conclusion

This project showcases a simple yet effective application of machine learning for spam detection in SMS text messages. It provides a real-time, interactive interface for users to test the model's predictions.
